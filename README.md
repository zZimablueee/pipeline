1.  The data floder includes input and output,       
the input is the raw database, calls 1600.csv
the output includes 2 tables:    
the games table:   mpi1686.csv   
the players table:   playerstats.csv

2.  the models folder have some files.And games_table8.py is to analyze the raw data with prefect,
    and player_table2.py is to generate the player table with prefect,
    checkcsv.ipynb is used to generate some simple graphs to check whether the calculation algorithms are correct.
